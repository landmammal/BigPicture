        // Your code below 

        // 1. ask the user for a number and store it in a variable

        // 2. create a for loop that counts to and including that variable

            // 3. log to the console the current number and the words " and am coming for you"

            // 4.create condition that checks if the current number is the users number and log "READY OR NOT HERE I GO"
        
        // end for loop
