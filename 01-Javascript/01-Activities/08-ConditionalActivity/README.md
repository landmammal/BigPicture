### Instructions

* Create a small JS program that asks users if they eat steak.

* If they respond with "yes", write the following to the console: "Here’s a Steak Sandwich!"

* If they respond with "no", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Tofu Stir-Fry!"

* **BONUS:** Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, alert the following: "No Sake for you!" TIP: you will need a comparison operator. google it!

* **HINT:** You will need to use `prompt() or confirm()` from the demos before.
