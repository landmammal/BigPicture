You are playing a game of hide and go seek you ask the user up to what number they want you to count, then you count up to that number in the console. 

### Instructions

* Create a small JS program that asks users for a number

* write to the console the number you are on and the words "coming for you" all the way to the number the user specified

* If you get to the number the user specified you write to the console "READY OR NOT HERE I GO"

* **BONUS:** Askt he user as soon as the page loads if they want to play hide and seek, if they say yes start the program you wrote above, if they say no write to the console "come back when you wanna play"

* **HINT:** You will need to use `prompt()` and a conditional statement similar like the demos before. and for the bonus you will need to use `confirm()`
